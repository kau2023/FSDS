    "Q1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "A relative path refers to the path of a file or directory relative to the current working directory of the program. In other words, it specifies the location of the file or directory relative to the location of the program that is accessing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the current working directory of a program is /home/user/, and there is a file named data.txt located in a directory called data that is also located in the /home/user/ directory, the relative path to the data.txt file would be data/data.txt. This is because the data directory is located in the same directory as the program, and the data.txt file is located inside the data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative paths are useful because they allow you to specify the location of files and directories without having to use the full absolute path. This can make it easier to move your program and its associated files to different locations on your computer or on different computers without having to update the file paths in your code.\n",
    "Q2.What does an absolute path start with your operating system?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "The format of an absolute path depends on the operating system being used, but in general, an absolute path starts with the root directory of the file system on the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, on Linux and macOS systems, an absolute path starts with a forward slash /, which represents the root directory of the file system. The rest of the path specifies the location of the file or directory relative to the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of an absolute path on a Linux or macOS system:\n",
    "/home/user/Documents/file.txt\n",
    "In this example, / represents the root directory, home is a subdirectory of the root directory, user is a subdirectory of the home directory, Documents is a subdirectory of the user directory, and file.txt is a file located inside the Documents directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows systems, an absolute path typically starts with a drive letter followed by a colon, such as C: or D:, and then a backslash \\. For example:\n",
    "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\file.txt\n",
    "Q3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "The os.getcwd() and os.chdir() functions are part of the os module in Python and are used for working with the current working directory of a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "os.getcwd(): This function returns a string representing the current working directory of the Python program. It does not take any arguments.\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use os.getcwd():\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "current_dir = os.getcwd()\n",
    "print(\"Current working directory is:\", current_dir)\n",
    "\n",
    "os.chdir(path): This function changes the current working directory of the Python program to the directory specified by path, which must be a string representing the new directory path.\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use os.chdir():\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.chdir('/path/to/new/directory')\n"

    "Q4. What are the . and .. folders?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "In a file system, . and .. are special directories that provide shortcuts to the \n",
    "current directory and its parent directory, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    ".: The . directory is a special directory that refers to the current directory. \n",
    "It is often used to specify the path of a file or directory relative to the current working directory of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "..: The .. directory is a special directory that refers to the parent directory \n",
    "of the current directory. It is also used to specify the path of a file or directory\n",
    "relative to the parent directory of the current working directory of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the current working directory of a program is /home/user/, the\n",
    ". directory refers to the /home/user/ directory, and the .. directory refers to \n",
    "the parent directory of /home/user/, which might be /home/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use . and .. in a file path:\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# get the path to a file in the current directory\n",
    "file_path = os.path.join('.', 'myfile.txt')\n",

    "Q5. In C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "    In the path C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt, the directory name is C:\\bacon\\eggs, and the base name is spam.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory name is the portion of the path that contains all the directories \n",
    "leading up to the base name. In this case, the directory name is C:\\bacon\\eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base name is the final portion of the path, which may be a file name or a directory \n",
    "name. In this case, the base name is spam.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between the directory name and base name is important when working with \n",
    "file paths in Python, as there are separate functions for working with these two parts \n",
    "of a path. For example, you can use the os.path.dirname() function to get the directory \n",
    "name, and the os.path.basename() function to get the base name.\n",
    "Q6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "The open() function in Python is used to open a file, and it takes two arguments: the file path (as a string), and the mode (as a string) in which the file will be opened. The mode argument is optional, and if it is not specified, the default mode is 'r', or read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several mode arguments that can be passed to the open() function in Python, but the three most commonly used modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (read mode): This mode is used for reading the contents of a file. The file must already exist, and the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file cannot be opened for reading, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): This mode is used for writing to a file. If the file already exists, it is truncated (i.e., its contents are deleted) before writing begins. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file cannot be opened for writing, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): This mode is used for appending data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file pointer is not at the end of the file, the data written will be appended to the end of the file. If the file cannot be opened for appending, an error is raised.\n",
    "# open a file for writing and write some data to it\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "Q7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "If an existing file is opened in write mode using the open() function in Python, the existing file is truncated (i.e., its contents are deleted) and a new, empty file is created in its place. This means that any existing data in the file is permanently lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "# open an existing file in write mode\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "Q8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "In Python, the read() and readlines() methods are used to read data from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The read() method reads the entire contents of the file as a single string. It takes an optional argument that specifies the maximum number of bytes to read. If no argument is specified, the entire file is read. Here's an example:\n",
    "# read the entire contents of a file\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    contents = f.read()\n",
    "    print(contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the read() method is used to read the entire contents of the file 'myfile.txt' into the variable contents. The print() function is then used to display the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the readlines() method reads the entire contents of the file into a list, where each element of the list is a line from the file. Here's an example:\n",
    "# read the contents of a file into a list of lines\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    lines = f.readlines()\n",
    "    print(lines)"

    "simple way to store and retrieve Python objects in a file-like database.\n",
