    "Q1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "In Python, the shutil module provides various file operations, including copying files and directories. Here's how you can distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree():\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copy(src, dst) - This function is used to copy a single file from the source path src to the destination path dst. It takes two arguments: the path to the source file, and the path to the destination file. If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "# copy a file from source to destination\n",
    "shutil.copy('/path/to/source/file.txt', '/path/to/destination/file.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copytree(src, dst) - This function is used to copy an entire directory tree from the source path src to the destination path dst. It recursively copies all files and subdirectories in the source directory to the destination directory. If the destination directory already exists, a FileExistsError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "# copy a directory tree from source to destination\n",
    "shutil.copytree('/path/to/source/directory', '/path/to/destination/directory')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "In Python, the os module provides various file-related operations, including renaming files. To rename a file, you can use the os.rename() function. It takes two arguments: the current path of the file you want to rename, and the new path with the new name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# rename a file\n",
    "os.rename('/path/to/oldfile.txt', '/path/to/newfile.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the file /path/to/oldfile.txt is renamed to /path/to/newfile.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the os.rename() function can also be used to move a file to a different directory by specifying a new directory path in the new file name argument.\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "The send2trash and shutil modules provide file deletion functions in Python, but they differ in their implementation and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The send2trash module provides a cross-platform safe way to delete files and directories by sending them to the system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. This allows for easy recovery of accidentally deleted files.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the shutil module provides low-level file operations, including deleting files and directories using the os.remove() and os.rmdir() functions. These functions immediately delete the files and directories and don't send them to the trash or recycle bin. This means that the deletion is permanent and can't be easily undone without data recovery tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between the delete functions in send2trash and shutil:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: send2trash uses system-specific code to send files to the trash or recycle bin, while shutil uses low-level file operations to delete files and directories directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety: send2trash provides an additional layer of safety by sending files to the trash or recycle bin instead of immediately deleting them. This allows for easy recovery in case of accidental deletions. In contrast, shutil immediately deletes files and directories without any safety net.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: send2trash works on all major operating systems, while shutil's deletion functions may have platform-specific quirks and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if you need a safe and cross-platform way to delete files and directories that can be easily undone, you should use send2trash. If you need low-level file operations that immediately delete files and directories, you should use the shutil module's deletion functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is\n",
    "equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "The ZipFile class in Python's zipfile module is used for working with zip archives. To open a zip file and create a ZipFile object, you can use the zipfile.ZipFile() method, which is equivalent to the open() method for File objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zipfile.ZipFile() method takes two arguments: the path to the zip file, and the mode in which to open it. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing (which overwrites an existing file), 'x' for writing (which raises an error if the file already exists), or 'a' for appending to an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example usage:\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "# open a zip file for reading\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile('myarchive.zip', 'r') as myzip:\n",
    "    # do something with the ZipFile object\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we open the zip file myarchive.zip for reading using the 'r' mode. We use a context manager (with statement) to ensure that the ZipFile object is automatically closed after we're done working with it. Inside the with block, we can access and manipulate the contents of the zip file using the myzip variable, which is a ZipFile object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf\n",
    "or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "Here's an example program that searches for all files with the .txt extension in a directory and its subdirectories, and copies them to a new folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "# set the source and destination directories\n",
    "source_dir = 'C:/Users/username/source_folder'\n",
    "dest_dir = 'C:/Users/username/destination_folder'\n",
    "\n",
    "# create the destination directory if it doesn't exist\n",
    "if not os.path.exists(dest_dir):\n",
    "    os.makedirs(dest_dir)\n",
    "\n",
    "# loop through the source directory and its subdirectories\n",
    "for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(source_dir):\n",
    "    # loop through the files in the current directory\n",
    "    for filename in filenames:\n",
    "        # check if the file has the .txt extension\n",
    "        if filename.endswith('.txt'):\n",
    "            # construct the full path of the source and destination files\n",
    "            src_file = os.path.join(foldername, filename)\n",
    "            dest_file = os.path.join(dest_dir, filename)\n",
    "            # copy the file to the destination directory\n",
    "            shutil.copy(src_file, dest_file)\n"
