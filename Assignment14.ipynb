    "Q1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "    RGBA stands for \"Red Green Blue Alpha\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a color model used in computer graphics and design, which represents a color as a combination of red, green, blue values and an alpha channel value. The alpha channel value determines the opacity of the color, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each color channel value in RGBA is typically represented as an integer value between 0 and 255, or as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0. The alpha channel value is also represented as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.\n",

    "To get the RGBA value of any image using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the getpixel() method of the Image object.\n",

    "Q3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "    In the context of the Pillow module in Python, a box tuple is a tuple containing four integer values that represent a rectangular region in an image. The four values represent the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle (x0, y0) and the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle (x1, y1), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The box tuple can be used in various methods of the Image class to perform operations on a rectangular region of an image, such as cropping or copying. For example, the crop() method takes a box tuple as an argument to specify the rectangular region of the image to crop.\n",

    "Here's an example of how a box tuple can be used to crop an image using the crop() method:\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",

    "cropped_image = image.crop(box)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the cropped image\n",
    "cropped_image.save('cropped_image.png')\n",
    "In this example, the box tuple (100, 100, 300, 300) represents a rectangular region with the top-left corner at coordinates (100, 100) and the bottom-right corner at coordinates (300, 300). The crop() method is called with this box tuple as an argument to extract this rectangular region from the original image. The resulting cropped_image object contains only the pixels within this rectangular region."
