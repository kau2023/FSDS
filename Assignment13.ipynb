    "q1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "Sol:\n",
    "    Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV spreadsheets, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting: Excel allows for more advanced formatting options such as conditional formatting, color coding, and the ability to merge cells. CSV files do not support any formatting options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas and functions: Excel has a wide range of built-in formulas and functions that can be used to perform calculations on data within the spreadsheet. While it is possible to perform basic calculations using CSV files, there are no built-in formulas or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charts and graphs: Excel allows users to easily create charts and graphs based on the data in the spreadsheet. This can be a useful way to visualize trends and patterns in the data. CSV files do not support the creation of charts or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation: Excel allows users to set up rules to validate data input, such as requiring specific data formats or restricting the range of values that can be entered. CSV files do not have this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple sheets: Excel allows users to create multiple sheets within a single workbook, making it easy to organize data and perform complex analyses. CSV files only contain a single sheet of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while CSV files are useful for storing and exchanging data in a simple format, Excel spreadsheets provide more advanced functionality for organizing, analyzing, and presenting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",

    "To create reader and writer objects in Python's csv module, you need to pass a file object as an argument to the csv.reader() and csv.writer() functions.\n",
